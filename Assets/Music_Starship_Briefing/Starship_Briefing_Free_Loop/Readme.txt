Starship Briefing [v1.0] FREE loop (C) Samplemind.com
======================================================

Thanks for downloading this song. I hope it will add good "push" to your project!

Starship Briefing is a futuristic song, with a cold and intense "universe" mood.
Soft, distant beginning, smooth transitions and “asteroid cloud chaos” are 
reflected in the sound. This music could fit well in your selection menus,
in-game scenes or film-like intros.

This free version contains a seamless loop, in full-quality 44.1khz, 16bit Wav.
I think it's suitable for selection menus or thigs like that. Up to you :)

Also, there is a paid version, which is a full song in 5 versions of different
lenghts. I also include 24 seamless loops, just a kit to build your perfect
version for your project. You can find the full version here:
